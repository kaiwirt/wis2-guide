==  WIS2 to GTS Gateway 
The Executive Council, with resolution 34 (EC-76), endorsed the WMO Information System 2.0 (WIS 2.0) implementation plan and recognized the importance of establishing a pilot phase to develop the WIS 2.0 infrastructure and begin testing it in order to be ready for a preoperational phase in 2024, and then for the transition starting on 2025. According to the WIS 2.0 implementation plan, the Global Telecommunication System (GTS) will be decommissioned by 2030, and National Meteorological and Hydrological Services NMHSs will use the WIS 2.0 platform for data exchange.
During the transition period, in order to avoid some WIS centers being forced to run both data-sharing frameworks simultaneously WIS 2.0 and GTS, with the challenges associated with maintaining two operational systems for the same purpose, a gateway from WIS 2.0 to GTS  will be designed during the pilot phase, taking into account the time required for Members to migrate to the new systems and minimizing the time a member has to operate both systems in parallel.
=== Purpose
The purpose of this gateway is to enable GTS members who have not yet migrated to WIS2 to continue to receive GTS data from GTS members who have migrated to WIS2 and stopped their GTS systems.
Note: Only data that have been already published in GTS are concerned by this gateway, new data will be available only on WIS2.
